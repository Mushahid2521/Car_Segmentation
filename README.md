## Car Segmentation
This project is motivated from this [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge). This is basically a segmentation problem. Here I have used [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) network architecture which do extremely well in medical segmentation tasks.

The network is designed using Keras framework. I have taken help from [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/keegil/keras-u-net-starter-lb-0-277/notebook) to build and fit the keras model. All the code description is present in Ipython notebook file.

Here is one of the test image result:
