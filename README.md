## Car Segmentation
This project is motivated from this [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge). This is basically a segmentation problem. Here I have used [UNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) network architecture which do extremely well in medical segmentation tasks.

The network is designed using Keras framework.
